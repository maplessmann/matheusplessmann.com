> A boilerplate for creating JavaScript tryouts and small projects quickly

A few days ago I was preparing a presentation to talk about useful things in
JavaScript that I learned throughout my career, that could help other developers
improve their code and logic.

It was a presentation full of code samples and live coding, so I created a
project with some features like Hot Reload, Babel and Prettier, to make it easy
for me to create some JavaScript code, using modern features of the language and
watching the changes automatically update in the browser without the need to
refresh the page.

I realized that whenever I need to start a JavaScript tryout, a small project or
a presentation with code samples, I end up creating the same setup, with the
same features. So I decided to create a boilerplate with everything I need to
run JavaScript code for this type of project, without having to worry about
configuration stuff.

The boilerplate is very small and comes with these cool features:

- üî• Hot Module Replacement for updating modules without needing a page refresh
- üê† Babel for modern JavaScript support
- ‚ú® Prettier for code formatting

You can find the boilerplate at
